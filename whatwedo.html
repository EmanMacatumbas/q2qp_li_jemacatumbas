                    We have been involved in many different projects and activities such as ALKASAMOPI which is a 
                    PWD drivers association that advocates for safe and accessible roads.
                    We also participate with the Philippine Children's Medical Center which is one of the 
                    government-owned and controlled corporate National Centers for Specialized Health Care under the 
                    Department of Health. There is also the building of the Welcome House which is recognized as the first crisis 
                    intervention center in the country. It is staffed by sisters and lay mission partners who are also professional 
                    guidance counselors and social workers where they conduct an outreach activity entitled GRLPWR together with our 
                    volunteers and partners from Pana.
